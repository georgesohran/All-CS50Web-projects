# Math drawing
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/OOxBY7DS3ac
#### Description:
This is my final project for CS50
## Libraries i used:
1. **tkinter**
for creating GUI
2. **numpy**
for one function that gives me a range of floats: _arange()_
3. **re**
to match formula that was given
4. **math**
to compute the functions like _cos, sin_, etc.

## How Does It Work?
### Main screen
The program opens the window with the help of Tkinter module. There is an entry for the formula, entry for the zoom value and a button that generates the graph on a dedicated canvas on the left of the window.
### Generating graphs
It works by getting users
